# LidarMoose
Analaysis of Lidar data at moose exclosure sites

Ingrid's master project

For now, the large las files are stored on my computer, C:\Users\Ingrid\Documents\Master - Sustherb\orginale_las, and on an external hard drive

Clipped las file are stored in LidarMoose, in the folder clipped_las


Canopy height is stored in rasterformat in LidarMoose, folder called canopy_height_clipped raster. Clipped because trees over 7 m has been excluded if present, since they most likely have been left standing during the clear cut.

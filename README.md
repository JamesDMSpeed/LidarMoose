# LidarMoose
Analaysis of Lidar data at moose exclosure sites

Ingrid's master project

For now, the large las files are stored on my computer, C:\Users\Ingrid\Documents\Master - Sustherb\orginale_las, and on an external hard drive

Clipped las files, 32x32 m, are stored in LidarMoose, in the folder clipped_las


Canopy height is stored in rasterformat in LidarMoose, folder called canopy_height_clipped raster (20x20m). Clipped because trees over 7 m has been excluded if present, since they most likely have been left standing during the clear cut. 


Results derived from the canopy height models are merged with the meta data table, this new table is called MyData.
